# ![alt text](images/pokeball.gif) My Pokédex App 

## Project Philosophy


Interested in learning about every single `Pokémon` created in the Pokéworld?  From original Pikachu all the way to Rattata-alola, this Pokédex app will show you all of the basic information you need to know about these interesting pocket monsters.  Navigate through the Poké pages, click on each Pokémon to view stats, and conduct your very own search for a specific Pokémon!

***GOTTA SEARCH 'EM ALL!***

**Note:** This project was created specifically for my Phase 1 Flatiron Project.
